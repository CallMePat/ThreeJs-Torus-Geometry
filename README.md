# ThreeJs-Torus-Geometry

A simple project demonstrating how to create and render a Torus geometry using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Features

- Renders a 3D Torus geometry in the browser using WebGL via Three.js.
- Interactive camera controls.
- Customizable torus parameters.

## Demo

(Add a screenshot or a link to a live demo here if available.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CallMePat/ThreeJs-Torus-Geometry.git
   cd ThreeJs-Torus-Geometry
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your setup).

## Usage

- Open the app in your browser.
- Use mouse controls to interact with the 3D torus.
- Edit the source files to customize geometry, materials, or lighting.
